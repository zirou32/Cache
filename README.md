# The Cache modulescript

_a useless modulescript :D_

## What is this module script for?

This modulescript was created to cache your game data, to make accessing it faster in the future.

## Should I use it in a real game?

It's totally up to you to use it or not, you probably won't get to use it for real, but if you do, I hope it works for you!
